Also you have to add FloatingActionButton and two items to bar at the top of the screen. You don't need to handle click on FloatingActionButton and on items in bar.


You can generate list of users in your code but it would be much better to implement request from application to download users from this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vyatsykiv/Flutter-Task/main/users.json). 

Icons:

- [Add](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vyatsykiv/Flutter-Task/main/ic_add_black.png) 


Implemented task must be shared via GitHub.
